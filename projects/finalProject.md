Our goal was to create a platform that UH students can use to safely buy and sell goods and appliances. Users are able to browse through posted items and contact sellers if they are interested in purchasing goods. There are user profiles to keep track of sellers and to display where an item is posted from. Inappropriate postings can be reported by other users, and site administrators may remove any post. The work was divided amongst the five members in our group. Communication, an essential part of this project, was made more difficult due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since we were not able to meet in person, communication was mainly through text and over Discord. Not working face to face was a challenge, but our team overcame this complication and managed to create an application for university students.

For this project, most of my contributions were on the front end. I created the about us page, portions of the profile and item pages, a lot of overall styling, and buttons with web functions. Additionally, I added some user functionality such as allowing users to delete their postings. Overall, this project has made me confident that I am able to create an organized professional website. My communication and collaboration skills were also greatly developed. Working together and voicing opinions and concerns productively was just as important to the project as programming.

This experience has taught me how to successfully work in groups to achieve a common goal. Communication and scheduling are key to having a successful group of programmers. Since we were working together, constant talking was needed to organize and divide tasks. I am now a lot more experienced as a programmer and working with others.
