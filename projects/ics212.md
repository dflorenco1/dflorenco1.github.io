This is a simple database application that was created for the final project in ICS 212. The functions of this app is meant for a bank to be able to keep track of its members. Members are created as structs and have various fields such as name, address, and account number. When a member is added to the program, their information is saved in the database and can be retrieved and manipulated. The program displays a menu with options corresponding to numbers 1-7. Menu options allow the user to add new members, delete members based on unique values, and retrieving and displaying members from the database.

After completing this application, I felt more confident in my C programming skills and project development awareness. I was shown the basic steps of planning and outlining an application. This activity showed me the importance of organization and how to take an idea and create a program from it.
