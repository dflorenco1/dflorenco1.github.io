People are expected to speak using proper grammar and practice correct punctuation in writing. Why should programming be any different? Coding standards is a great way to create code that is easy to read and understandable. This is highly beneficial when working with multiple people and large projects. Keeping track of the code and recognizing its outcome is a lot more effortless when it is written in a neat and concise way. ESLint is a powerful tool that, if followed, ensures code to be organized and universally accepted. 

I do not think there are any negatives that come with practicing appropriate coding styles. In the work environment communication is key. It is crucial to be able to portray thoughts and ideas in a way that can be grasped by others. Coding is no different. Most of the time, programmers are part of teams and collaborate closely with each other, so writing code that can be easily followed makes work more efficient and less time consuming. As a software engineering student, there have been countless amounts of times where I am lost looking over past assignments and code. I often don’t recognize why I wrote something the way I did or why I used a particular function. This could have been avoided by using proper coding styles. 

ESLint provides a criteria that will make code look more formulated and put together. I enjoy using this in IntelliJ because it makes my own code easier to read and comprehend. There are only positive effects using ESLint, however I do not think it will improve one’s coding ability. Yes, it will make code easier on the eyes, but it will not make one understand a language better. Coding styles are useful for reading and sharing code, but from my personal experiences, it has not helped me learn a language better. Learning code comes from studying and practice. I feel that writing code in a specific way will not help you better understand a language, but will prevent a lot of headaches when reviewing and overseeing large files. I know I did something right when someone can look over my code and know quickly what it is trying to accomplish. Contrary to popular belief, complicated code is not impressive; rather simple code is seen as more elegant. Coding standards help achieve this.

In conclusion, only good can come out of using ESLint and other check styles. I support practicing proper coding techniques and styles. This will make you a better programmer, look more appealing to a potential employer, and easier to work with. I do not think code styles will help learn languages, but it definitely improves you as an overall coder and should be practiced by all who practice software engineering.
