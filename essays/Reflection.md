Prior to taking this class, I was expecting to learn about HTML, CSS, and the foundations of becoming a professional web developer. All of these things were achieved, but what I did not know is that this course had even more to offer. Development environments, user interface frameworks, and project management are all areas I developed and gained more knowledge in as a student programmer. Programming is more than learning and language and applying it as you feel, it is about communicating and creating something that people can use and benefit from. 

Gaining experience with development environments such as IntelliJ and GitHub has given me something that I am able to use and apply in the future. IntelliJ organizes all source code in a neat and orderly fashion while being very compatible with GitHub when updating code. GitHub is something I needed to get familiar with, but after some time using it there are clear benefits. Being able to make adjustments to code with partners and merging edits together was very useful when creating our final web application. This taught us communication skills and project management between group members, GitHub is something that I will be using a lot and is essential when sharing and editing code with others.

Another topic covered was user interface frameworks and this made life much easier when designing applications. Frameworks like Semantic-UI were introduced and allow programmers to use premade components that are previously styled and can be adjusted to fit individual applications. Semantic-UI made it very easy to customize layouts and allows a lot of freedom in design and formatting. This is very beneficial to programmers because it saves a lot of time when you are able to take from a collection of styled items instead of creating your own. The documentation on the Semantic-UI website is easy to follow and is a great resource when designing a web application. Learning how to use frameworks saves a lot of time and makes my work look neater and more organized.

Overall, my knowledge and confidence of software engineering has progressed by leaps and bounds. I am now way more aware of what it takes to become a web developer and how to work on applications in groups and the amount of communications it takes to be successful. My awareness of development environments is far greater than before this class and my over coding and web development skills have increased tremendously. User interface frameworks is something that I am able to apply to projects and persona l applications in the future. This course has broadened my horizons and shed some light on the world of programming. I know this is just the beginning and am excited to learn more about myself, software, and coding.
